It helps improve your productivity because you can instantly review the output and \nstay engaged.  \nThe key advantages of streaming summaries include:  \n• Real- time  streaming : As Acrobat or A crobat Reader processes a lengthy PDF, it \nconcurrently streams summaries for sections it has already analyzed. It helps eliminate \nany latency associated with summarizing voluminous content.  \n• Segmented  display : When you start generating the summary for your content, you'll \nimmediately see summarized content for the sections that the Generative summary \nfeature finished processing.  \n• Parallel processing : While you engage with the summarized sections, the feature \nextracts headings, and generates summaries for the subsequent sections.  \n \nUse generative AI features in meeting apps  \nYou can harness the power of generative AI features in Acrobat to gain insights from transcripts of online meetings in Microsoft Teams and Zoom.
